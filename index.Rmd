## What you can expect from the module

### Educational Aims

This course aims to provide the student with a basic understanding of methods and issues involved with collecting, analysing, and presenting data.

### Learning Outcomes

- Employ basic public health research.
- Demonstrate the use of core public health research principles in the field.
- Appropriately examine and interpret research findings.
- Appraise findings and formulate the conclusions of this research.

### Assessment Details

The assessment is composed of assignments (8) (40% of total mark), presentation (10%), and final report (50%). Specific assignments will be provided to students after the moderation process begins.

The assignments will be:

1. calculating data statistics,
2. plotting figures for data visualization,
3. drawing mind maps for research design,
4. writing a lab/field report,
5. making an academic poster,
6. writing an article/thesis,
7. making slides, and
8. building a research website.

The presentation will be:

- presenting a poster.

The final reports will include:

1. writing a final report, and
2. giving an oral presentation.

### Methods of Learning and Teaching

The course will be delivered through a series of lectures, seminars, case study presentations, and group work. The students will be required to participate in seminars through presentation and discussion. Students are expected to spend an adequate amount of time in private independent study and are expected to have read relevant materials before class.

## Further Information

### Student Feedback

The University is keen to elicit student feedback to make improvements for each module in every session. It is the University policy that the preferred way of achieving this is by means of an Online Module Evaluation Questionnaire Survey. Students will be invited to complete the questionnaire survey for this module at the end of the semester.

You are strongly advised to read the policies mentioned below very carefully, which will help you better perform in your academicstudies.  All the policies and regulations related to your academic study can be found in Student Academic Services section under the heading “Policies and Regulations” on  [E-bridge ](https://ebridge.xjtlu.edu.cn/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn).

### Plagiarism, Cheating, and Fabrication of Data.

Offences of this type can result in attendance at a University-level committee and penalties being imposed. You need to be familiar with the rules. Please see the “Academic Integrity Policy” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’.

### Rules of submission for assessed coursework

The University has detailed rules and procedures governing the submission of assessed coursework. You need to be familiar with them. Details can be found in the “Code of Practice for Assessment” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’. 

### Late Submission of Assessed Coursework

The University attaches penalties to the late submission of assessed coursework. You need to be familiar with the University’s rules. Details can be found in the “Code of Practice for Assessment” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’.  

### Mitigating Circumstances

The University is able to take into account mitigating circumstances, such as illness or personal circumstances which may have adversely affected student performance on a module. It is the student’s responsibility to keep their Academic Advisor, Programme Director, or Head of Department informed of illness and other factors affecting their progress during the year and especially during the examination period. Students who believe that their performance on an examination or assessed coursework may have been impaired by illness, or other exceptional circumstances should follow the procedures set out in the “Mitigating Circumstances Policy”, which can be found on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’.  

### ICE and GitHub

Copies of lecture notes and other materials are available electronically through GitHub.

They might be moved to ICE, the University’s virtual learning environment at [ICE @ XJTLU](http://ice.xjtlu.edu.cn/), in the future.

## Required materials

As this module is focused on data analysis, every student must work on a computer with internet access. Either Windows, macOS or Linux is accepted.

Data processing and presenting software packages must be installed in your computer. As our assignments will be reproducible, R Markdown is the first choice in the class, and RStudio is an enhanced user interface for R. We are going to work with markdown in the framework of reproducible research, thus Typora is recommend as a markdown editor. If you don’t like R, you can use Jupyter notebook for your assignments and final reports. However, all the examples in the lectures will be given in R.

*Reproducible research* by Wikipedia:

> The term *reproducible research* refers to the idea that the ultimate product of [academic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_research) is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks and full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research. Typical examples of reproducible research comprise compendia of data, code and text files, often organised around an [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) source document or a [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupyter) notebook.

Sometimes, if we have to use office packages,  OpenOffice or LibreOffice is recommended. We **WON’T** use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) in the class unless we have no other choices. After class, you are free to use any software as you like.

Install R in Windows like this:

1. Open the download page on R official website: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.
2. Click ‘Download R x.x.x for Windows’ (x.x.x is the version, e.g. 3.6.2) at the top of the webpage, and the installation file will be downloaded.
3. Double click the downloaded file and follow the instruction until it is installed.

```

```

## Markdown syntax

All your assigned coursework (exercises and assignments) must be reproducible, i.e. given in markdown syntax in this module.

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
